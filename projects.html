            <p>One of my first projects was a classic Snake game that I built from scratch in Java. It's a simple game with a nostalgic feel that challenges players to grow their snake while avoiding obstacles.
                 I enjoyed working on this project because it allowed me to practice my programming skills and experiment with game design. It's a fun game that I hope will entertain and challenge players of all ages.

                    The menu provides a range of options to the user:
                    
                    
                    - “New Game”: upon clicking this option it launches the user into the game field to begin playing.
                    - “How To Play”: provides instruction in game to the player about movement and aim of the game.
                    - “Leaderboard”: the leaderboard displays the top 13 scores or fewer (depending on the number of the saved scores in total).
                    - “Exit Game”: This option leads to closing the game/ application.
                    - Background music button: upon clicking the button it leads to muting or unmuting the background music of the game’
                    - Sound effects button: upon clicking it leads to muting or unmuting of the sound effects such as the eating voice while playing the game.

                    <img width="498" alt="second-screen" style="width: 400px; height: 400px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113339617/221370975-c71d3c67-93bd-41f3-b8c5-f2a4114cbacc.png">
                    
                    
                    The snake can move in 4 directions, which can be controlled by using particular keys from the keyboard. The user can either use the arrow keys or the W-A-S-D keys to move the snake. 
                    
                    Moving the snake in specific Directions and keys on the keyboard allowing the movement:
                    - Up - Arrow up / W 
                    - Down - Arrow down / S 
                    - Right - Arrow right / D 
                    - Left - Arrow left / A 
                    
                    
                    #### <ins>**Eating food**</ins>
                    
                    
                    On the field, a mouse is spawned  at a random position. It is never located at the tile currently occupied by any part of the Snake. The user should move the head of the Snake to the same tile, where the Mouse is placed in order to “eat” it. Once the mouse is eaten, the snake grows by one body part and a new mouse is spawned in the field. Moreover, with every mouse eaten, the score of the player increases by 1. Eating the mouse, or more like trying to do that, is a part of the game that makes it entertaining since firstly, it enables the player to get a higher score and secondly, it is challenging to actually make the Snake move in the right direction to consume the Mouse. Moreover, the Game is getting more and more demanding as the Snake grows and it’s easier to bump into it, so the maneuvers need to be more deliberate in order not to lose.

                    Once the game is over, the Game Over scene is shown where the player can save the score they have just obtained by writing their name in the window and pressing the “Enter” key. The name of the previous player is always saved in the “Name” field so that the user does not have to type their name again every time. Once the user presses enter, the name and score are saved and added to the Leader Board if the score is high enough. If the user returns to the menu or starts a new game without saving the result right away, the result will be lost.

                    All information about how to play the snake game can be found in the “How to play” section once the button “How to play” is clicked in the Menu. You can escape the “How To Play” section by clicking the “Back To Menu” button in the top left corner.

                    The Leaderboard option can be accessed through the main menu of the game. It will open a list of top 13 scores or fewer of the players on the particular device showing their name and score in descending order. 13 scores are displayed if at least 14 are saved. If the number of scores doesn’t exceed 13, all the scores will be displayed in the Leaderboard in the right order. You can escape the Leaderboard section by clicking the “Back To Menu” button.

                    The sound effects include the sound of “crunching” when the Snake eats the Mouse and the jingle played when the game is over. 
                    - The sound effects can be manipulated by the button in the Main Menu. 
                    - The Sound Effects are muted by default, so the user needs to click the button to turn them on, if they decide to use them.
                    Background Music is also turned off by default and in order to turn it on, the button at the right bottom in the Snake Game Menu needs to be clicked.
